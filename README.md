## 💡 The Vibe Coding Philosophy

**Vibe coding** means:
- Focusing on what the app should do, not how to code it perfectly
- Letting modern tools handle the heavy lifting
- Learning by building, not by memorizing
- Shipping imperfect work and improving it

**It's NOT:**
- Traditional coding education
- Memorizing syntax
- Building perfect code on the first try
- Waiting until you're "ready" to ship

---

## 🛠️ The Stack (All Free to Start)

1. **Firebase Studio** — Backend, auth, database, and hosting in one place
2. **GitHub** — Your source of truth and project history
3. **Cursor** — AI-powered code editor that understands your project

You don't need $300/month in tools. You need these three.

This isn't a traditional coding course. I don't gatekeep, I don't overload you with theory, and I don't expect you to become a "real developer" before you ship something.

This is the exact workflow I use to build and ship software that makes money.
