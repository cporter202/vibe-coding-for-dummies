## 💡 The Vibe Coding Philosophy

**Vibe coding** means:
- Focusing on what the app should do, not how to code it perfectly
- Letting modern tools handle the heavy lifting
- Learning by building, not by memorizing
- Shipping imperfect work and improving it

**It's NOT:**
- Traditional coding education
- Memorizing syntax
- Building perfect code on the first try
- Waiting until you're "ready" to ship

---

## 🛠️ The Stack (All Free to Start)

1. **Firebase Studio** — Backend, auth, database, and hosting in one place
2. **GitHub** — Your source of truth and project history
3. **Cursor** — AI-powered code editor that understands your project

You don't need $300/month in tools. You need these three.

### The Workflow

**Here's how you'll actually use them:**

1. **Build project bones in Firebase Studio** — Use prompts to create the basic structure
2. **Publish from Firebase Studio** — Creates your project in Firebase Console
3. **Enable services in Firebase Console** — Enable Auth, Firestore, Hosting (makes everything easier later)
4. **Sync to GitHub** — Firebase Studio creates your GitHub repo automatically (removes GitHub setup friction)
5. **Clone to Cursor** — Build fast with AI (all services already configured)
6. **Sync back and deploy** — Deploy from Firebase Studio (one-click deployment)

**Build bones → Publish → Enable services → Sync to GitHub → Build in Cursor → Deploy. Repeat.**

**Key points:** 
- Build project bones first (the structure)
- Publish before syncing to GitHub (enables services)
- Enable all services early (makes Cursor work easier)
- Firebase Studio creates your GitHub repo automatically
- Keep repos private and don't commit secret keys

Each tool does what it's best at. You don't fight the tools.
