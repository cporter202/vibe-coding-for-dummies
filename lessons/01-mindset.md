# 🧠 SECTION 0 — Before You Start (Mindset Reset)

Most people fail at vibe coding before they even start. Not because they lack talent or intelligence, but because they're carrying the wrong mindset.

This section resets your thinking so you can actually build instead of getting stuck.

## Lesson 0.1 — What "Vibe Coding" Actually Means

### What Vibe Coding IS

**Vibe coding** is building software by focusing on **what you want to happen**, not memorizing how to write code.

It's the difference between:
- ❌ "I need to learn React, TypeScript, and Node.js before I can build"
- ✅ "I want an app where users can log in and save notes"

If you can explain what you want, you can build it. That's vibe coding.

### What Vibe Coding Is NOT

- **It's not cheating** — Using AI to build is like using a calculator instead of doing math by hand. It's smart, not lazy.
- **It's not "fake coding"** — You're building real software that real people use. That's real.
- **It's not skipping fundamentals** — You're learning the fundamentals that matter: how to think, build, and ship.

### Why Traditional Tutorials Fail Beginners

Traditional coding education teaches you:
- Syntax first (memorize this, memorize that)
- Theory before practice
- "Learn everything" before building anything

**Result:** You spend months learning and never ship anything.

Vibe coding flips this:
- **Outcomes first** — What should the app do?
- **Practice immediately** — Build while you learn
- **Learn what you need** — When you need it

### Using AI as a Builder, Not a Cheat

Here's the mindset shift:

**Old way:** "I need to learn to code, then I can build."

**Vibe coding way:** "I need to build something, and AI helps me do it."

AI (like Cursor) is your co-builder. It handles the syntax. You handle the thinking.

**You're not cheating. You're being efficient.**

### Thinking in Outcomes, Not Syntax

Instead of thinking:
- "How do I write a function in JavaScript?"
- "What's the syntax for authentication?"

Think:
- "I want users to be able to log in"
- "I want users to save their data"

Describe the behavior. Let the tools figure out the code.

### Key Takeaway

**If you can explain what you want, you can build it.**

That's the entire philosophy. Everything else is just execution.

## Lesson 0.2 — What You Will (and Won't) Learn Here

### What You WON'T Learn

- ❌ How to memorize code syntax
- ❌ Every tool and framework in existence
- ❌ How to become a "real developer" (whatever that means)
- ❌ Perfect code architecture on day one

### What You WILL Learn

- ✅ How to start a project (without overthinking)
- ✅ How to build something real (even if it's ugly)
- ✅ How to ship it (get it live on the internet)
- ✅ How to improve it (iterate based on feedback)

### The Real Goal

By the end of this course, you'll have:
1. Built a real app (not a tutorial copy)
2. Deployed it to the internet (it's live, people can use it)
3. Understood the workflow (so you can do it again)
4. Learned how to turn this into money (because that's the point)

### This Course vs. Daily Training

**This course = Foundation**

You'll learn:
- The mindset
- The tools
- The workflow
- One complete build

**Daily Skool training = Real progress**

Inside the [Vibe Coding with Chris Skool community](https://www.skool.com/vibe-coding-with-chris-7196), you get:
- Daily lessons and build walkthroughs
- Real projects broken down step-by-step
- Feedback on your builds
- Shipping accountability
- How to turn simple apps into things people pay for

**The course gets you started. The community keeps you building.**

## 🎯 Action Step

Before moving to Section 1, answer this:

**What's one thing you want to build that you've been putting off?**

Write it in one sentence. No tech words. Just what you want it to do.

Example: "I want something that helps people track their daily habits without using spreadsheets."

**That's your first project idea. We'll come back to it in Section 4.**
