# 🎯 FINAL SECTION — What's Next

You've made it through the course. You understand the mindset, the tools, the workflow, and how to turn this into money.

But this is just the beginning. Real progress happens with daily reps, not one-time courses.

This section shows you what's next and how to keep building.

## Lesson 7.1 — Why This GitHub Course Is Only the Beginning

### This Course = Foundation

**What you've learned:**
- The vibe coding mindset
- The tools (Firebase Studio, GitHub, Cursor)
- The workflow (build, commit, deploy)
- How to ship your first app
- How to think about monetization

**That's the foundation. That's enough to start.**

### Real Progress = Daily Reps

**But here's the reality:**

- **One course** = Knowledge
- **Daily practice** = Skill
- **Daily building** = Real progress

**You don't get good at vibe coding by reading about it. You get good by doing it every day.**

### Feedback Loops

**The real learning happens when:**
- You build something
- You ship it
- You get feedback
- You improve it
- You ship again

**That's the feedback loop. That's how you actually learn.**

**This course gives you the foundation. Daily practice gives you the skill.**

### Shipping Publicly

**There's a difference between:**
- Building in private (learning slowly)
- Shipping publicly (learning fast)

**When you ship publicly:**
- You get real feedback
- You see what works
- You learn what doesn't
- You improve faster

**This course teaches you how to ship. Daily practice teaches you how to ship well.**

### The Gap

**There's a gap between:**
- Knowing how to build (this course)
- Actually building consistently (daily practice)

**Most people fall into the gap:**
- They take the course
- They understand the concepts
- They never build consistently
- They never get good

**Don't fall into the gap. Keep building.**
